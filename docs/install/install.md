3. **Setup Connectqueue**<br>
    - !!!__backup your current connectqueue resource__!!!
    - replace it with the one from your version package

4. **qb-core**<br>
    - !!!__backup your current `events.lua` file__!!! within `qb-core/server/`
    - replace it with the one from your version package

5. **database setup (i'm not responsible for any lost data)**<br>
    - !!!__backup your database__!!! best practice is to save one with the data and one with clean tables
    - if you use qbus skip this step otherwise insert the tables from bm-tables.sql within your database
    - __for qbcore-framework users__
        - after you made a backup of your current database alter it and delete the tables within
        - then execute the qb-database.sql file within you database
        - when you got your new tables setup you can then insert your old data and should be good to go
